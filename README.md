# UMD

## Dependencies
Required Ubuntu dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y libhwloc-dev
```

## Build flow
We are transitioning away from Make. The main libraries and tests should now be built with CMake.
The device lib is built once for all supported architectures (grayskull, wormhole and blackhole).

To build `libdevice.so`: 
```
cmake -B build -G Ninja
ninja -C build
# or
ninja umd_device -C build
```

Tests are build separatelly for each architecture.
Specify the `ARCH_NAME` environment variable as `grayskull`,  `wormhole_b0` or `blackhole` before building.
You also need to configure cmake to enable tests, hence the need to run cmake configuration step again.
To build tests:
```
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DTT_UMD_BUILD_TESTS=ON
ninja umd_tests -C build
```

## As a submodule/external project
If your project has CMake support, simply add this repo as a subdirectory:
```
add_subdirectory(<path to umd>)
```
You can then use `libdevice.so` by linking against the `umd_device` target wheverever is needed.
```
target_link_libraries(tt_metal PUBLIC umd_device)
```

## Deprecated Make flow
This flow is no longer maintained. `libdevice.so` will build however if you want to run tests, we suggest using the CMake flow

Required Ubuntu dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libhwloc-dev libgtest-dev libboost-dev
```

This target builds `libdevice.so`. Specify the `ARCH_NAME` environment variable when building (`wormhole_b0` or `grayskull`):

```
make build
```

Run this target to build library, and gtest suite.

```
make test
```

Running test suite:

```
make run
```

To Clean build directory
```
make clean
```

To change device selection, change the `ARCH_NAME` flag in the top-level Makefile or run:

```
make build ARCH_NAME=...
make test ARCH_NAME=...
```
