# UMD

## Dependencies
Required Ubuntu dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y libhwloc-dev
```

## Build flow
We are transitioning away from Make. The main libraries and tests should now be built with CMake.
Specify the `ARCH_NAME` environment variable as `grayskull` or `wormhole_b0` before building.

To build `libdevice.so`: 
```
cmake -B build -G Ninja
ninja -C build
# or
ninja umd_device -C build
```

To build tests:
```
ninja umd_tests -C build
```

## As a submodule/external project
If your project has CMake support, simply add this repo as a subdirectory:
```
add_subdirectory(<path to umd>)
```
You can then use `libdevice.so` by linking against the `umd_device` target wheverever is needed.
```
target_link_libraries(tt_metal PUBLIC umd_device)
```

## Deprecated Make flow
This flow is no longer maintained. `libdevice.so` will build however if you want to run tests, we suggest using the CMake flow

Required Ubuntu dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libhwloc-dev libgtest-dev libboost-dev
```

This target builds `libdevice.so`. Specify the `ARCH_NAME` environment variable when building (`wormhole_b0` or `grayskull`):

```
make build
```

Run this target to build library, and gtest suite.

```
make test
```

Running test suite:

```
make run
```

To Clean build directory
```
make clean
```

To change device selection, change the `ARCH_NAME` flag in the top-level Makefile or run:

```
make build ARCH_NAME=...
make test ARCH_NAME=...
```
